# Customer Segmentation Project

## Overview

I developed this Customer Segmentation project using K-Means clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and a Decision Tree classifier, achieving an impressive 93% accuracy in categorizing customers based on their behaviors and demographics. To make the results accessible and actionable, I built an interactive Streamlit web application, enabling businesses to analyze and act on customer insights effectively.

## Features

### K-Means Clustering: Groups customers into meaningful segments.

### PCA (Principal Component Analysis): Reduces dimensionality for better visualization and model efficiency.

### Decision Tree Classifier: Predicts customer segments with 93% accuracy.

### Streamlit Web App: Interactive tool for visualizing clusters and decision tree results.

## Technologies Used

### Python

### Scikit-Learn

### Pandas & NumPy

### Matplotlib & Seaborn

### Streamlit
